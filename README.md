# chromium-updater-console
Chromium updater for Windows built with .net

Will download binaries from https://chromium.woolyss.com/
Using the api that is documented at https://chromium.woolyss.com/#api

# Limitations
The current functionality will download 64-bit version.

# Why?
I couldn't get https://github.com/henrypp/chrlauncher to update my Chromium so I just made this super simple console application with the basic functionality that I wanted.

# How to use it
1. Download the binaries https://github.com/rikard-engstrom/chromium-updater-console/raw/master/Binaries-1.0.0.0.zip
2. Unzip to a folder where you want to keep the binaries for the browser
3. Run ChromiumUpdaterConsole.exe
